Hi, I’m Natalie (@dixonnataliej). I’m a Computer Science student at the University of Michigan, focusing on expanding my knowledge and skills to prepare for real-world applications. Currently, I’m working on self-studying foundational concepts and exploring new technologies. Check out my projects to see my progress and what I’m working on! :)
